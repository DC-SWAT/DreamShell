/** \file    sd.h
    \brief   Block-level access to an SD card attached to the SCI or SCIF port.
    \ingroup vfs_sd

    This file contains the interface to working with SD card readers.
    The original SD card reader designed by jj1odm connects to the SCIF port,
    while the SCI port implementation was developed by SWAT (Ruslan Rostovtsev). 
    The SCIF implementation uses bit-banging technique to emulate SPI protocol,
    while the SCI implementation utilizes the synchronous mode of this interface,
    which is very similar to SPI.

    For reference, all I/O through this code should be done in the order of SD
    card blocks (which are 512 bytes a piece). Also, this should adequately
    support SD and SDHC cards (and possibly SDXC, but I don't have any of them
    to try out).

    This code doesn't directly implement any filesystems on top of the SD card,
    but rather provides you with direct block-level access. This probably will
    not be useful to most people in its current form (without a filesystem), but
    this will provide you with all of the building blocks you should need to
    actually make it work for you.

    Due to the patent-encumbered nature of certain parts of the FAT32
    filesystem, that filesystem will likely never be supported in KOS proper
    (unless, of course, people are still using KOS after those patents expire).
    I'm not going to encourage anyone to violate Microsoft's patents on FAT32
    and I'm not going to be the enabler for anyone to do so either. So, if you
    want FAT32, you're on your own.
