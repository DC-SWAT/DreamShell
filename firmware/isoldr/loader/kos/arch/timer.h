    \brief  Low-level timer functionality.

    This file contains functions for interacting with the timer sources on the
    SH4. Many of these functions may interfere with thread operation or other
    such things, and should thus be used with caution. Basically, the only
    functionality that you might use in practice in here in normal programs is
    the gettime functions.
