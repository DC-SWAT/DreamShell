/** \file    dc/g2bus.h
    \brief   G2 bus memory interface.
    \ingroup system_g2bus

    This file provides low-level support for accessing devices on the G2 bus in
    the Dreamcast. The G2 bus contains the AICA, as well as the expansion port.
    Generally, you won't be dealing with things at this level, but rather on the
    level of the device you're actually interested in working with. Most of the
    expansion port devices (the modem, bba, and lan adapter) all have their own
    drivers that work off of this functionality.

    The G2 bus is notoroiously picky about a lot of things. You have to be
    careful to use the right access size for whatever you're working with. Also
    you can't be doing PIO and DMA at the same time. Finally, there's a FIFO to
    contend with when you're doing PIO stuff as well. Generally, G2 is a pain in
    the rear, so you really do want to be using the higher-level stuff related
    to each device if at all possible!
