# DreamShell Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between:

- **You** (the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution), and
- **Project Owner**: Ruslan Rostovtsev (SWAT) ("Project Owner").

If You are submitting on behalf of an employer or another legal entity, You represent that You
have authority to bind that entity, and "You" refers to that entity.

## 1. Definitions

"Contribution" means any work of authorship, including any modifications, additions, or
derivative works, that You intentionally submit to the Project Owner for inclusion in DreamShell
and its components (including ISO Loader), whether submitted by email, pull request, patch, or
any other form of written communication.

## 2. Copyright License Grant

You grant to the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution and such derivative works.

This grant includes the right for the Project Owner to **relicense** Your Contribution, and
works that incorporate it, under any terms (including commercial license terms), at the Project
Owner's discretion.

## 3. Patent License Grant

You grant to the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your
Contribution with the project to which it was submitted.

## 4. Your Representations

You represent that:

- You have the legal right to grant the licenses in this Agreement.
- Your Contribution is an original work of authorship by You, or You have sufficient rights to
  submit it under this Agreement.
- To the best of Your knowledge, Your Contribution does not knowingly include third-party code
  under terms incompatible with submission under this Agreement.

## 5. Disclaimer

Except as stated in this Agreement, Your Contribution is provided "AS IS", without warranties
or conditions of any kind.

## 6. Submission of Contributions

Unless You explicitly state otherwise in writing at the time You submit a Contribution, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion is subject to this Agreement.

## 7. Miscellaneous

This Agreement does not grant You rights to use the Project Owner's trademarks.

This Agreement is separate from, and does not modify, the applicable license terms for the
project (for example, `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`). This Agreement governs the rights You grant to
the Project Owner for Your Contributions.
