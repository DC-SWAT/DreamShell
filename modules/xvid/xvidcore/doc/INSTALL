1/ Generic install procedure for Unix based systems
===================================================

This build process works for most common Unix based systems, including
GNU/Linux, (Free|Open|Net)BSD, Solaris and faked unix environments
like cygwin and minsys on Win32 platforms.

  1.a/ Requirements
  -----------------
   - ANSI C compiler (gcc)
   - make (GNU make, BSD make, Solaris make)
   - a C library providing ANSI C functions like malloc/free/realloc
     and some other standard functions.
   - yasm or nasm on ia32/x86_64 platforms for MMX/SSE optimized code.

 
  1.b/ How to build from a release tarball
  ----------------------------------------

Get the latest version on http://www.xvid.org/, and uncompress it on
your disk. Let's name the resulting source directory ${xvidcore}.

The next step allows you to configure the xvid sources.
  # cd ${xvidcore}/build/generic
  # ./configure

Some building options can be tuned thanks to the ./configure tool. You
can use your own CC and CFLAGS variables in order to override xvid's
default ones. To have a list of known options:
  # ./configure --help

Now xvidcore is configured according to your specific platform. You
can still handwrite the platform.inc file in order to add/remove
specific flags that ./configure may have set them wrong.

It is time to build xvidcore:
  # make

That creates a =build directory where all object files go, and where
the build targets are linked. If no error was reported by the build
process, then you can install it on your system:
  # make install

This copies the shared and static libraries to the prefix location
passed to the ./configure tool (/usr/local by default). The xvid.h
include file is also copied during the "make install" run.

Voila, xvidcore is installed on your system, make sure your runtime
linker knows about the xvidcore prefix lib dir where it is
installed. And make also sure that it generates a symlink to its
SONAME. In case it would do not take care of the symlink itself:
  # cd ${prefix}/lib
  # ls libxvidcore.so.*
    ls should list at least one libxvidcore.so.MAJOR.MINOR file
  # ln -s libxvidcore.so.MAJOR.MINOR libxvidcore.so.MAJOR

You may also add a .so link to .so.MAJOR, so that applications linked
against .so are in fact linked to .so.MAJOR and thus ensures better
binary compatibility as we take care not changing the MAJOR number
until there is an incompatible ABI change.
  # ln -s libxvidcore.so.MAJOR libxvidcore.so


  1.c/ How to build from CVS
  --------------------------

In order to build from CVS, you need some more requirements compared
to the release building process:
  - GNU autoconf >= 2.5
  - GNU automake (no specific version)
  - GNU libtool (no specific version)

Grab the desired CVS version you want to build.
  # cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xvid.org:/xvid login
    (just type enter)
  # cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xvid.org:/xvid co xvidcore
    (read the CVS documentation if you want details about branch
     checking outs)

You now need to bootstrap the build files:
  # cd xvidcore/build/generic
  # ./bootstrap.sh

A configure script has been bootstraped, you're now able to follow
the "Build from release tarballs" steps.


  1.d/ Cross compiling xvidcore.
  ------------------------------

The configure script allows an easy handling of cross compilation. You
have just to specify the host and build platform values.

e.g: building Win32 libxvidcore.dll from a gnu/linux systems
 # cd ${xvidcore}/build/generic
 # ./configure --host=i386-mingw32 --build=i386-pc-linux-gnu

And then build as usual.

As the example uses the Win32 target, we can even build the vfw frontend.
Additional requirements are:
 - Resource compiler (the Makefile uses the syntax of windres from the
   GNU CC suite, but you can easily modify the cmd line)
 - GNU make (other make programs may have problem with shell expansion)

So to cross compile the VFW frontend, you just need to override the
Makefile variables pointing to the compiler and the resource compiler.
These variables are CC and WINDRES.
 # cd ${xvidcore}/vfw/bin
 # make CC=i386-mingw32-gcc WINDRES=i386-mingw32-windres


  1.e/ What is the meaning of xvidcore Makefile output.
  -----------------------------------------------------

The makefile available in ${xvidcore}/build/generic is handwritten and
outputs uncommon building progress strings to the terminal. You may
want to understanding their meaning. Here is a brief explaination.

  - A: a/dir/file.(asm|s)
    This an assembling rule assembling 'a/dir/file.(asm|s)'
  - C: a/dir/file.c
    This is a compilation rule compiling 'a/dir/file.c'
  - Cl: Stuff
    This is a cleaning rule in action
  - D: Directory
    This is a rule creating 'Directory'
  - I: a/dir/file
    Installing 'file' in 'a/dir'
  - L: file
    Linking 'file'
  - W: file
    Compiling the Win32 resource 'file'


  1.f/ Building a Debian package.
  -------------------------------

Release tarballs contain a debian dir so that you can easily build a
debian package. Just execute the usual steps. They may be sumed up to:
  # cd ${xvidcore}
  # dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

If all went right, you're now able to install the package:
  # cd ..
  # dpkg -i libxvidcore...



2/ Generic install procedure for Win32/MSVC.
============================================



  2.a/ Requirements.
  ------------------

    - MS Visual C++ 2005 or later
    - nasm installed as 'nasm' in the msvc binary search paths.

  2.b/ How to build the VFW frontend from a release tarball.
  ----------------------------------------------------------

Download the latest source distribution from http://www.xvid.org/ and
uncompress it on your disk. Let's call this directory ${xvidcore}.

    - Make sure your ${xvidcore} directory name does not contain spaces.
      MS Visual C++ can have issues handling file names with whitespace.
    - Open the workspace libxvidcore.sln located in
      ${xvidcore}/build/win32.
    - Then choose the libxvidcore project as the Active project of the
      workspace.
    - Make sure the Active configuration is
      'libxvidcore Win32 Release'
    - Build the project (F7)
    - Open the project vfw.vcproj file located in ${xvidcore}/vfw.
    - Make sure the Active configuration is
      'vfw Win32 Release'
    - Build the project (F7)
    - Install the resulting VFW frontend using the xvid.inf file
      provided in ${xvidcore}/vfw/bin. Right click on the file, and
      then click 'Install'

  2.c/ How to build from CVS.
  ---------------------------

You have first to retrieve the sources from the Xvid CVS repository
using a tool like WinCVS. Then follow the normal steps explained in
the previous section.

NB: your CVS program may not convert text files to the cr/lf windows
    text. In that case opening project files in MSVC will result in
    some weird error messages from MSVC. To fix that, you have to
    convert all .dsp files to the cr/lf format. You can do that
    opening the .dsp file in WordPad and saving it. It should now be
    in cr/lf format.
