Coding Conventions for Tsunami
------------------------------

KOS specifies C coding conventions pretty thoroughly, but not C++
conventions. This document will fill that space for Tsunami.

The quickest explanation is by example:

class SomeClass {
public:
	SomeClass();
	virtual ~SomeClass();

	int getCoolProperty() const { return m_member; }
	void setCoolProperty(int value) { m_member = value; }

	void doSomething(int parameter);

	enum CoolEnum {
		Value1,
		Value2,
		Value3
	};

	static const int Constant;

private:
	int	m_member;
};


In short:
- Types are CamelNames with upper case at the front
- Methods/properties are camelNames with lower case at the front
- Constants are like type names
- Generally all members should be private, and have an m_ prefix.
- Things that don't modify the class should be const.
