- RefCnt base object for reference counting of objects. Reference count
  debugging which stores a list of source addresses for things that have
  a reference.
- Texture object to wrap the texture management above.
- Font object to wrap the font stuff above.
- Drawable object to represent some drawable thing, potentially with
  sub-things. These can work like a windowing GUI where the child
  coords/rotation/alpha/etc depend on the parent coords/rotation/alpha/etc.
- Animation objects which can be attached to one or more Drawables to
  animate them.
- Trigger objects which can be actived due to various events
  (time/frame offset, end of animation, etc) and can cause other
  events (new Animation, Drawable death, etc).
- Environmental objects which affect non-visual things but are
  animatable like Drawables, or cause animation like Animation
  objects: BGM volume control, sound effects, controller inputs, etc.
- A crapload of predefined objects of each of the above types
  (cube, sphere, mouse pointer, scrolling background, banner,
  label, etc).
- Code written only to Tsunami should be mostly portable to another
  platform provided a port is done of any plat-specific code in the
  actual object draw routines.
